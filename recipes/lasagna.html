        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. <br>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. <br>
        Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. <br>
        Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
        Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. <br>
        Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. <br>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, <br>
        remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. <br>
        Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. <br>
        Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. <br>
        Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
        Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, <br>
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. <br>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. <br>
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, <br>
        either spray foil with cooking spray, <br>
        or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.
        Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.
        Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
