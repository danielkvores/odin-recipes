            Spread 1/2 of the rice evenly on nori sheet, <br>
            using a little water on your hands or a spoon to keep rice from sticking. <br>

            and roll nori sheet around rice and veggies, using the bamboo mat to help. <br>

        <li>Cut each roll into 6 small pieces <br>
            and put them in the refrigerator until cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
